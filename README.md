## Overview
This project is forecasting the outcomes of both the men's and women's 2024 collegiate basketball tournaments, a portfolio of brackets based on historical data. We are provided by data on historical NCAA games to forecast the outcomes of the Division 1 Men's and Women's basketball tournaments.
### Dataset Description
Each season there are thousands of NCAA basketball games played between Division I college basketball teams, culminating in March Madness®, the 68-team national championship that starts in the middle of March. We are provided with a large amount of historical data about college basketball games and teams, going back many years. Armed with this historical data, we can explore it and develop our distinctive ways of predicting March Madness® game outcomes. We can even evaluate and compare different approaches by seeing which of them would have done best at predicting tournament games from the past.
